# ðŸ§ª FPU FIFO UVM Testbench

This repository implements a **UVM (Universal Verification Methodology)** testbench for verifying the **FIFO Buffer** of the Floating Point Unit (FPU) project.  
The structure follows the provided verification architecture with agents, monitors, scoreboards, and randomized floating-point stimulus.

---

## ðŸš€ How to Build and Run

### 1. **Prerequisites**
- A simulator with UVM support (e.g., **QuestaSim/ModelSim**, **Synopsys VCS**, **Cadence Xcelium**)
- Ensure the UVM library is available (`uvm_pkg`)

---

### 2. **Compile the Testbench**
```bash
make compile
```


### 3. **Run the Simulation**
```bash
make run
```

This will:

Compile all SystemVerilog sources
Run the UVM test
Exit after completion

### 4. **Clean Build Artifacts**
```bash
make clean
```

## ðŸ›  Features

âœ… UVM Agents for FIFO and Clock stimulus
âœ… Scoreboards to validate data correctness and flag behavior
âœ… Monitors to collect transactions and send them to analysis ports
âœ… Randomized Floating-Point Stimulus
     - Generates special cases: NaN, +Inf, -Inf, Subnormal, and normal FP values
âœ… Config DB Integration for seamless virtual interface sharing
âœ… Makefile Automation for easy compilation & simulation


## ðŸ“Œ How It Works

1. FIFO Agent: Drives random data and control signals to the DUT
2. Clock Agent: Generates clock and reset sequences
3. Monitors: Observe DUT signals and send transactions to scoreboards
4. Scoreboards: Compare observed results against expected outcomes
5. Environment: Instantiates and connects agents, monitors, and scoreboards
6. Test: Configures and launches the verification sequences


## âœ… Example Simulation Output

When running, you should see UVM logs like:
```css
UVM_INFO @ 50ns: uvm_test_top.env.d_sb [DATA_SB] Checking data: FP DATA=3F800000 WRITE=1 READ=0
UVM_INFO @ 55ns: uvm_test_top.env.f_sb [FLAG_SB] Checking flag: FP DATA=7FC00000 WRITE=0 READ=0

```
